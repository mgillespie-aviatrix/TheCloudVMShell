# TheCloudVMShell
This is a tool to easily SSH into AWS and Azure virtual instances. It performs lookups of systems and IPs and provides an easy menu to select which host to access.

In the event a virtual instance does not have a public IP, the CloudVM Shell will prompt the end user for another machine to use as a proxy system. This allows easy access
to a private system by means of a publicly facing virtual machine.
